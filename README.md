## Quck visual of what I have created
ADD PICTURES HERE

ADD VIDEO HERE

There are some aspects of the main file missing, I use a common.yaml file, you can use as many as you like, I'll probably split out fonts and  a few other items as well to clean the mess up TBC...

I have added this into the code, <<: !include common.yaml

It includes the following

logger: | api: | ota: | wifi: | ap: | button: | text_sensor:

These are all the common/reusable settings I use for all projects.  To create this just create a new device but without all the extra crap and place what you wnat in there.  This can be placed elsewhere in the file structure, but I leave it here for easy access.
